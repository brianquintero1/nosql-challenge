Module 12 Challenge

All work is found in the data files. The initial challenge was in importing the establishments.json file through the Terminal. In the part where I deleted the Dover documents I would go back and run the code and the initial code used to find the number of Dover documents would also show 0. To get past this I would reload the establishments.json and everything seemed to reset. However, when I got to part two I noticed I had a lot more rows. I then re-imported the json file and the number seemed to increase. I did these more times and it increased more each time. I noticed that all the increased numbers were divisible by 41 so I figured out that each time I was loading the json file it would duplicate all rows. The solution was found in adding the --drop portion to the text used to import the data. I had left it out initially and each time I imported the data from the establishments collection it was being added on to the existing collections. It was a great learning experience.
